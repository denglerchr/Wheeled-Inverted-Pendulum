# Wheeled-Inverted-Pendulum
## Description
This repo contains the required resources to build and deploy a relatively inexpensive wheeled inverted pendulum. It was build to provide an easily upgradable and programmable test-bed for control algorithms. The final robot can ba programmed in python and accesses via wifi. It can compute computationally heavy (-> compared to other stuff done in control community) control algorithms on the raspberry pi, e.g. evaluate a neural network of mediocre size.

While it is a one man project, I am grateful for every tip and improvement. Feel free to make a pull request.

**Important notes:**
* While the robot is running, the state of this repo is far from done, especially the doc and also a rework of the hardware are on my list, hopefully I can get some of that stuff done in Q1-2 2019.
* I provide this as is, but do not provide any sort of support or debugging, so please avoid writing me messages like: "It doesnt work and I don't know why. Please help me, here's a low res picture."
