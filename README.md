# Wheeled-Inverted-Pendulum
## Description
This repo contains the required resources to build and deploy a relatively inexpensive wheeled inverted pendulum. It was build to provide an easily upgradable and programmable test-bed for control algorithms. The final robot can be programmed in python and accesses via wifi. It can compute computationally heavy (-> compared to other stuff done in control community) control algorithms on the raspberry pi, e.g. evaluate a neural network of mediocre size.
